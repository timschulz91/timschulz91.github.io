My name is Tim Schulz. I just finished my Masters in Economics and am looking
for a job in and around beautiful Vancouver, BC. Some more information about me
can be found [here](about.html).

# Grad School
Two examples of some of my grad school projects are

#####[my MA paper](ma_paper.html),
  in which I describe how the introduction of new smartphones affects mobile
  internet usage in different languages using Wikimedia page traffic as an
  example, and

#####[my project in Experimental Economics](828project.html),
  in which I propose an experiment that helps identify how people perceive the
  severity of different degrees of inequality depending on whether they are
  themselves rich or poor.
