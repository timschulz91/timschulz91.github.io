title: "About Me"
---

I just finished up my Masters in Economics at Simon Fraser University. I have a
knack for everything data and tech/computer related. Being in job search mode, I
am hoping to find a job that lets me work in the area of data analysis (ideally
with emphasis on coding) or anything quantitative, really. The practical
implementation of this could be in the immediate context of a company's core
business or take on a wider scope in the context of consulting.

Hoping to work in a data related job, I focused on econometrics courses during
grad school. Some more details on that can be found on my
[LinkedIn profile](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/timschulz91) or by looking at my 
[MA project](https://github.com/timschulz91/ma-project) for an example of my
work.

If you're interested in me as a professional, then this is me:

```{r, out.width = 400, fig.retina = NULL, echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("professional.jpg")
```

If you're interested in me as a person, then this is more like it:

```{r, out.width = 400, fig.retina = NULL, echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("fun.jpg")
```

I also love snowboarding (SPEED!!!) and enjoy a good game of soccer as long as
people don't take things too seriously. Reading is a great way to kill some free
time as well.
