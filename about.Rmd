title: "About Me"
---

I am just about to finish up my Masters in Economics at Simon Fraser University. I have a
knack for everything data and tech/computer related. Being in job search mode, I am hoping 
to find a job that lets me work in the area of data analysis (ideally with emphasis on
coding). In preparation for this, I focused on econometrics courses during grad school.
Some more details on that on my [LinkedIn](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/timschulz91)

I also love snowboarding (SPEED!!!) and enjoy a good game of soccer as long as people don't
take things too seriously. Reading is a great way to kill some free time (what's that?) as
well.
