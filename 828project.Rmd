title: "Experimental Economics Project"

The paper can be found [here](grad_school/828Paper.html) and the project
including a brief, preliminary Monte Carlo simulation of the experiment can be
found [here](https://github.com/timschulz91/econ828project).

The goal of this project was to propose an experiment that either extends an
existing experiment or implements theory in a laboratory environment for the
first time. I propose a model that describes how rich and poor people behave in 
the presence of inequality depending on their respective beliefs about how
others (or society) perceive this inequality. Then, I design an experiment that
tests this model. Since the experiment is not actually implemented in practice
(no funds and not enough time given the scope of the course), I simulate some
results instead.
